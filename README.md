This repo contains the application that was written as a demo for WOWODC 2013.

It is a working, though primitive, CMS system that demonstrates the use of Apache Cayenne
with Tapestry and JAX RS (REST) interfaces. It demos advanced features like caching and 
synchronizing caches over a cluster. It is made of a set of branches showing how
the app evolution progressed from a simple webapp to HTML/REST webapp, to multi-module webapp,
to a webapp with cluster-synchronized caches.

"master" branch contains the latest most advanced version.
